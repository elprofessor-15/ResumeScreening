# ResumeScreening
This repository automates resume classification using machine learning. It preprocesses resume data, cleans text, and extracts features using TF-IDF vectorization. A K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier with OneVsRest strategy is used to categorize resumes, providing an efficient solution for resume screening.
